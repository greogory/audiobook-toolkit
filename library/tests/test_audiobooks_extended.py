"""
Extended tests for audiobooks module.

Tests the additional audiobooks endpoints and data enrichment:
- GET /api/audiobooks/<id> - single audiobook with enriched data
- GET /api/stream/<id> - stream audiobook file
- GET /api/audiobooks with enrichment (genres, eras, topics, edition counts)

Note: These tests use mocking instead of direct DB insertion to avoid
session-scoped database conflicts.
