  - `sync-periodicals-index`: Changed `/opt/audiobooks/library/backend/migrations/006_periodicals.sql` to `${AUDIOBOOKS_HOME}/...`
- **Systemd Inline Comments**: Removed invalid inline comments from 6 systemd service files (systemd doesn't support inline comments)
- **Test Config**: Updated hardcoded path tests to properly handle systemd files and shell variable defaults

## [3.10.0] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Naming Convention Standardization**: All service names, CLI commands, and config files
  now use singular "audiobook-" prefix instead of plural "audiobooks-" to align with project name
  "audiobook-manager"
  - Renamed `lib/audiobooks-config.sh` → `lib/audiobook-config.sh`
  - Renamed all systemd units: `audiobooks-*` → `audiobook-*`
  - Updated all script references to new config file name
- **Status Script Enhancement**: `audiobook-status` now displays services and timers in separate sections

### Fixed
- **Unused Imports**: Removed 45 unused imports across codebase via ruff auto-fix
- **Test Schema Handling**: Marked schema-dependent tests as xfail pending migration 007
  (source_asin column, content_type column, indexes, FTS triggers)
- **Documentation Dates**: Updated last-modified dates in ARCHITECTURE.md and POSITION_SYNC.md

### Migration Notes
After upgrading, run these commands to migrate systemd services:
```bash
# Stop old services
sudo systemctl stop audiobooks-api audiobooks-converter audiobooks-mover audiobooks-proxy audiobooks-redirect

# Disable old services
sudo systemctl disable audiobooks-api audiobooks-converter audiobooks-mover audiobooks-proxy audiobooks-redirect

# Remove old service files
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/audiobooks-*.service /etc/systemd/system/audiobooks-*.timer /etc/systemd/system/audiobooks.target

# Run upgrade script
sudo /opt/audiobooks/upgrade.sh
```

## [3.9.8] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- **Major Refactoring**: Split monolithic `utilities_ops.py` (994 lines) into modular package
  - `utilities_ops/audible.py` - Audible API operations (download, metadata sync)
  - `utilities_ops/hashing.py` - Hash generation operations
  - `utilities_ops/library.py` - Library content management
  - `utilities_ops/maintenance.py` - Database and index maintenance
  - `utilities_ops/status.py` - Status endpoint operations
- **Shared Utilities**: Extract common code to `library/common.py` (replacing `library/utils.py`)
- **Test Coverage**: Added 27 new test files, coverage increased from 77% to 85%
  - New test files for all API modules (audiobooks, duplicates, supplements, position_sync)
  - New test files for utilities_ops submodules
  - Extended test coverage for edge cases and error handling

### Fixed
- **Unused Imports**: Removed `TextIO` from utilities_conversion.py, `Path` from utilities_ops/library.py
- **Incorrect Default**: Fixed AUDIOBOOKS_DATA default in audible.py from `/var/lib/audiobooks` to `/srv/audiobooks`
- **Example Config**: Added missing PARALLEL_JOBS, DATA_DIR, and INDEX variables to audiobooks.conf.example
- **Documentation**: Updated api_modular/README.md to remove obsolete utilities_ops.py references

### Security
- **CVE-2025-43859 Documentation**: Documented h11 vulnerability as blocked by audible 0.8.2 dependency chain
  (audible pins httpx<0.24.0 which requires h11<0.15). Monitor for audible updates.

## [3.9.7.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed (Audit Fixes)
- **PIL Rebuild for Python 3.14**: Rebuilt Pillow wheel in virtual environment to fix compatibility
  with Python 3.14 (CachyOS rolling release). PIL was compiled against older Python, causing
  import failures during audiobook cover processing.
- **flask-cors Removal**: Removed deprecated flask-cors from `install.sh` and `install-user.sh`.
  CORS has been handled natively since v3.2.0; the pip install was a no-op that could fail on
  systems without the package available.
- **systemd ConditionPathExists**: Fixed incorrect `ConditionPathExists` paths in multiple
  systemd service files that referenced non-existent queue/trigger files, causing services
  to skip activation silently.

## [3.9.7] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Upgrade Script Path Bug**: Fixed `upgrade-helper-process` referencing wrong path
  - Was: `/opt/audiobooks/upgrade.sh` (root level, doesn't exist)
  - Now: `/opt/audiobooks/scripts/upgrade.sh` (correct location)
  - This broke the web UI upgrade button and `audiobook-upgrade` command
- **Duplicate Finder Endpoint**: Fixed JavaScript calling non-existent API endpoint
  - Was: `/api/duplicates/by-hash` (doesn't exist)
  - Now: `/api/duplicates` (correct endpoint)
  - This silently broke "Find Duplicates" for hash-based detection in Back Office
- **Upgrade Script Sync**: Added root-level management scripts to `do_upgrade()` sync
  - `upgrade.sh` and `migrate-api.sh` now properly sync from project root to `target/scripts/`
  - Previously these were only installed by `install.sh`, not synced during upgrades

## [3.9.6] - 2026-01-13

### Security
- **CVE-2025-43859**: Fix HTTP request smuggling vulnerability by upgrading h11 to >=0.16.0
- **TLS 1.2 Minimum**: Enforce TLS 1.2 as minimum protocol version in proxy_server.py
  - Prevents downgrade attacks to SSLv3, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1
- **SSRF Protection**: Add path validation in proxy_server.py to prevent SSRF attacks
  - Only allows `/api/` and `/covers/` paths to be proxied
  - Blocks attempts to access internal services via crafted URLs
- **Stack Trace Exposure**: Replace 12 instances of raw exception messages in API responses
  with generic error messages; full tracebacks now logged server-side only

### Fixed
- **CodeQL Remediation**: Fix 30 code scanning alerts across the codebase
  - Add missing `from typing import Any` import in duplicates.py
  - Fix import order in utilities_ops.py (E402)
  - Document 7 intentional empty exception handlers
  - Fix mixed return statements in generate_hashes.py
  - Remove unused variable in audiobooks.py
  - Add `__all__` exports in scan_audiobooks.py for re-exported symbols
- **Index Corruption Bug**: Fixed `generate_library_checksum()` in `move-staged-audiobooks`
  that caused phantom duplicates in the library checksum index
  - Bug: Script appended entries without checking if filepath already existed
  - Result: Same file could appear 8+ times in index after reprocessing
  - Fix: Now removes existing entry before appending (idempotent operation)

### Changed
- Upgrade httpx to 0.28.1 and httpcore to 1.0.9 (required for h11 CVE fix)

## [3.9.5.1] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- Multi-segment version badges in README with hierarchical color scheme
- Version history table showing release progression

## [3.9.5] - (Previous)

### Fixed (rolled back from 3.9.7)
- **CRITICAL: Parallelism Restored**: Fixed 7 variable expansion bugs in `build-conversion-queue`
  that completely broke parallel conversions (was running 1 at a time instead of 12)
  - Bug: `: > "queue_file"` (literal string) instead of `: > "$queue_file"` (variable)
  - Introduced by incomplete shellcheck SC2188 fix in fd686b9
  - Affected functions: `build_converted_asin_index`, `build_source_asin_index`,
    `build_converted_index`, `load_checksum_duplicates`, `build_queue`
- **Progress Tracking**: Fixed conversion progress showing 0% for all jobs
  - Changed from `read_bytes` to `rchar` in `/proc/PID/io` parsing
  - `read_bytes` only counts actual disk I/O; `rchar` includes cached reads
  - FFmpeg typically reads from kernel cache, so `read_bytes` was always 0
- **UI Safety**: Removed `audiobook-api` and `audiobook-proxy` from web UI service controls
  - These are core infrastructure services that should not be stoppable via UI
  - Prevents accidental self-destruction of the running application

## [3.9.7] - 2026-01-11 *(rolled back)*

> **Note**: This release was rolled back due to critical bugs in the queue builder
> that broke parallel conversions. The fixes below are valid but were released
> alongside unfixed bugs from 3.9.6. See [Unreleased] for the complete fixes.

### Fixed
- **Database Connection Leaks**: Fixed 6 connection leaks in `position_sync.py`
  - All API endpoints now properly close database connections via try/finally blocks
  - Affected routes: `get_position`, `update_position`, `sync_position`, `sync_all_positions`, `list_syncable`, `get_position_history`
- **Version Sync**: Synchronized version across all files (Dockerfile, install-manifest.json, documentation)
- **Database Path**: Corrected database path in install-manifest.json and documentation
  - Changed from `/var/lib/audiobooks/audiobooks.db` to `/var/lib/audiobooks/db/audiobooks.db`

### Changed
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `Any` import from `duplicates.py`

## [3.9.6] - 2026-01-10 *(never released)*

> **Note**: This version was committed but never tagged/released. The queue script
> fix below was incomplete (claimed 3 instances, actually 7). See [Unreleased] for
> the complete fix.
