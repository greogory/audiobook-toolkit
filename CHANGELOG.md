## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed
- Refactored utilities.py (1067 lines) into 4 focused sub-modules:
  - `utilities_crud.py`: CRUD operations (259 lines)
  - `utilities_db.py`: Database maintenance (291 lines)
  - `utilities_ops.py`: Async operations with progress tracking (322 lines)
  - `utilities_conversion.py`: Conversion monitoring with extracted helpers (294 lines)
- Refactored scanner modules with new shared `metadata_utils.py`:
  - Extracted genre taxonomy, topic keywords, and metadata extraction helpers
  - `scan_audiobooks.py`: D(24) → A(3) complexity on main function
  - `add_new_audiobooks.py`: D(21) → C(13) max complexity
  - Average scanner complexity now B(5.2)
- Reduced average cyclomatic complexity from D (high) to A (3.7)
- Extracted helper functions (`get_ffmpeg_processes`, `parse_job_io`, `get_system_stats`) for testability

### Fixed
- Fixed conversion progress showing "100% Complete" while active FFmpeg processes still running
- Fixed REMAINING and QUEUE SIZE showing 0 when conversions are in-progress (now shows active count)
- Removed unused imports and variables (code cleanup)
- Removed orphaned test fixtures from conftest.py
- Updated Dockerfile version default to match current VERSION

## [3.4.1] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md guide with:
  - System component diagrams and symlink architecture
  - Install, upgrade, and migrate workflow diagrams
  - Storage tier recommendations by component type
  - Filesystem recommendations (ext4, XFS, Btrfs, ZFS, F2FS)
  - Kernel compatibility matrix (LTS through rolling release)
  - I/O scheduler recommendations
- Installed directory structure documentation in README.md

### Changed
- `install.sh` now uses `/opt/audiobooks` as canonical install location instead of `/usr/local/lib/audiobooks`
- Wrapper scripts now source from `/opt/audiobooks/lib/audiobooks-config.sh` (canonical path)
- Added backward-compatibility symlink `/usr/local/lib/audiobooks` → `/opt/audiobooks/lib/`
- `install.sh` now automatically enables and starts services after installation (no manual step needed)
- `migrate-api.sh` now stops services before migration and starts them after (proper lifecycle management)
- `/etc/profile.d/audiobooks.sh` now sources from canonical `/opt/audiobooks/lib/` path

### Fixed
- Fixed `install.sh` to create symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/` instead of copying scripts
- Fixed proxy server to forward `/covers/` requests to API backend

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Per-job conversion stats with progress percentage and throughput (MiB/s)
- Sortable Active Conversions list (by percent, throughput, or name)
- Expandable conversion details panel in Back Office UI
- Text-search based collection subgenres: Short Stories & Anthologies, Action & Adventure, Historical Fiction
- Short Stories collection detects: editor in author field, ": Stories" suffix, "Complete/Collected" patterns

### Changed
- Active conversions now use light background with dark text for better readability
- Cover art now stored in data directory (`${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}/.covers`) instead of application directory
- Config template uses `${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}` references for portability across installations
- Scripts now installed to `/opt/audiobooks/scripts/` (canonical) with symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Clear separation: `/opt/audiobooks/` (application), `${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}/` (user data), `/var/lib/` (database)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `DATA_DIR` config not reading from `/etc/audiobooks/audiobooks.conf`, which caused "Reimport Database" to read from test fixtures instead of production data
- Fixed collection genre queries to match actual database genre names (Fiction, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, etc.)
- Fixed queue count sync - now shows actual remaining files instead of stale queue.txt count
- Fixed cover serving to use `COVER_DIR` from config instead of hardcoded path
- Fixed proxy server to forward `/covers/` requests to API backend (was returning 404)
- Fixed `install.sh` to create symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/` instead of copying scripts (upgrades now automatically update commands)
- Removed false-positive Romance collection (was matching "Romantics" literary movement and "Neuromancer")
- Added test data validation in `import_to_db.py` to prevent importing test fixtures
- Fixed Docker entrypoint paths: `api.py` → `api_server.py`, `web-v2` → `web`
- Fixed UI contrast and added ionice for faster conversions
- Improved conversion details panel legibility and data display
- Cleaned up obsolete scripts and symlinks from user data directory

- `build-conversion-queue` script for index-based queue building with ASIN + unique non-ASIN support
- `find-duplicate-sources` script for identifying duplicate .aaxc files
- Incremental audiobook scanner with progress tracking UI
- Ananicy rules for ffmpeg priority tuning during conversions
