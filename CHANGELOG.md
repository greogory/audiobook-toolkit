## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [3.5.4] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **upgrade.sh**: Self-healing tarball extraction with flexible pattern matching (backport from main)
  - Now tries multiple directory patterns (`audiobook-manager-*`, `audiobooks-*`, `Audiobook-Manager-*`)
  - Fallback pattern for any versioned directory (`*-[0-9]*`)
  - Added debug output showing temp dir contents on extraction failure
  - Prevents bootstrap problems where old upgrade scripts can't upgrade themselves

## [3.5.3] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed
- **Bash scripts**: Fixed `log()` function to work with `set -e` (use `if/then` instead of `&&`)
  - Affects: `build-conversion-queue`, `cleanup-stale-indexes`
- **API project discovery**: Replaced hardcoded `/raid0/ClaudeCodeProjects` with configurable search
  - Now checks: `AUDIOBOOKS_PROJECT_DIR` env, `~/ClaudeCodeProjects`, `/raid0/ClaudeCodeProjects`, `~/projects`, `/opt/projects`

## [3.5.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **upgrade.sh**: Fixed GitHub release extraction failing with "Could not find extracted directory"
  - Changed glob pattern from `audiobooks-*` to `audiobook-manager-*` to match actual tarball structure
- **upgrade.sh**: Fixed project upgrade (`--from-project`) failing with exit code 1 when no upgrade needed
  - Now exits cleanly with code 0 when versions are identical (matches GitHub mode behavior)
  - Fixes web UI upgrade from project showing "Upgrade failed" when already up to date

## [3.5.1] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Privilege-separated helper service**: System operations (service control, upgrades) now work
  with the API's `NoNewPrivileges=yes` security hardening via a helper service pattern
  - `audiobooks-upgrade-helper.service`: Runs privileged operations as root
  - `audiobooks-upgrade-helper.path`: Watches for request files to trigger helper
  - Control files stored in `/var/lib/audiobooks/.control/` (avoids systemd namespace issues)

### Changed
- **API utilities_system.py**: Refactored from direct sudo calls to file-based IPC with helper
- **install.sh/upgrade.sh**: Now deploy the helper service units

### Fixed
- Service control (start/stop/restart) from web UI now works with sandboxed API
- Upgrade from web UI now works with `NoNewPrivileges=yes` security hardening
- Race condition in status polling that caused false failure responses

## [3.5.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Checksum tracking**: MD5 checksums (first 1MB) generated automatically during download and move operations
- **Generate Checksums button**: New Utilities maintenance feature for Sources AND Library with hover tooltips
- **Index cleanup script**: `cleanup-stale-indexes` removes entries for deleted files from all indexes
- Automatic index cleanup: Deleted files are removed from checksum indexes via delete operations
- Real-time index updates after each conversion completes
- Prominent remaining summary box in Conversion Monitor
- Inline database import in Back Office UI

### Changed
- **Bulk Operations redesign**: Clear step-by-step workflow with explanatory intro, descriptive filter options, and use-case examples
- **Conversion queue**: Hybrid ASIN + title matching for accurate queue building
- Removed redundant "Audiobooks" tab from Back Office (audiobook search available on main library page)
- Updated "Generate Hashes" button tooltip to clarify it regenerates ALL hashes
- Download and mover services now append checksums to index files in real-time
- Mover timing optimization: reduced file age check from 5min to 1min, polling from 5min to 30sec

### Fixed
- Fixed chapters.json ASIN extraction in cleanup script (ASINs are in JSON content, not filename)
- Queue builder robustness: title normalization, subshell issues, edition handling
- Version display fixes in Back Office header

## [3.4.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed
- Refactored utilities.py (1067 lines) into 4 focused sub-modules:
  - `utilities_crud.py`: CRUD operations (259 lines)
  - `utilities_db.py`: Database maintenance (291 lines)
  - `utilities_ops.py`: Async operations with progress tracking (322 lines)
  - `utilities_conversion.py`: Conversion monitoring with extracted helpers (294 lines)
- Refactored scanner modules with new shared `metadata_utils.py`:
  - Extracted genre taxonomy, topic keywords, and metadata extraction helpers
  - `scan_audiobooks.py`: D(24) → A(3) complexity on main function
  - `add_new_audiobooks.py`: D(21) → C(13) max complexity
  - Average scanner complexity now B(5.2)
- Reduced average cyclomatic complexity from D (high) to A (3.7)
- Extracted helper functions (`get_ffmpeg_processes`, `parse_job_io`, `get_system_stats`) for testability

### Fixed
- Fixed conversion progress showing "100% Complete" while active FFmpeg processes still running
- Fixed REMAINING and QUEUE SIZE showing 0 when conversions are in-progress (now shows active count)
- Removed unused imports and variables (code cleanup)

  - Filesystem recommendations (ext4, XFS, Btrfs, ZFS, F2FS)
  - Kernel compatibility matrix (LTS through rolling release)

### Changed
- `install.sh` now uses `/opt/audiobooks` as canonical install location instead of `/usr/local/lib/audiobooks`
- Wrapper scripts now source from `/opt/audiobooks/lib/audiobooks-config.sh` (canonical path)
- Added backward-compatibility symlink `/usr/local/lib/audiobooks` → `/opt/audiobooks/lib/`
- `install.sh` now automatically enables and starts services after installation (no manual step needed)
- `migrate-api.sh` now stops services before migration and starts them after (proper lifecycle management)
- `/etc/profile.d/audiobooks.sh` now sources from canonical `/opt/audiobooks/lib/` path

### Fixed
- Fixed `install.sh` to create symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/` instead of copying scripts

## [3.4.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added
- Per-job conversion stats with progress percentage and throughput (MiB/s)
- Sortable Active Conversions list (by percent, throughput, or name)
- Expandable conversion details panel in Back Office UI
- Text-search based collection subgenres: Short Stories & Anthologies, Action & Adventure, Historical Fiction
- Short Stories collection detects: editor in author field, ": Stories" suffix, "Complete/Collected" patterns

### Changed
- Active conversions now use light background with dark text for better readability
- Cover art now stored in data directory (`${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}/.covers`) instead of application directory
- Config template uses `${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}` references for portability across installations
- Scripts now installed to `/opt/audiobooks/scripts/` (canonical) with symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/`
- Clear separation: `/opt/audiobooks/` (application), `${AUDIOBOOKS_DATA}/` (user data), `/var/lib/` (database)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `DATA_DIR` config not reading from `/etc/audiobooks/audiobooks.conf`, which caused "Reimport Database" to read from test fixtures instead of production data
- Fixed collection genre queries to match actual database genre names (Fiction, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, etc.)
- Fixed queue count sync - now shows actual remaining files instead of stale queue.txt count
- Fixed cover serving to use `COVER_DIR` from config instead of hardcoded path
- Fixed proxy server to forward `/covers/` requests to API backend (was returning 404)

- Removed false-positive Romance collection (was matching "Romantics" literary movement and "Neuromancer")
- Added test data validation in `import_to_db.py` to prevent importing test fixtures
- Fixed Docker entrypoint paths: `api.py` → `api_server.py`, `web-v2` → `web`
- Fixed UI contrast and added ionice for faster conversions
- Improved conversion details panel legibility and data display
- Cleaned up obsolete scripts and symlinks from user data directory
